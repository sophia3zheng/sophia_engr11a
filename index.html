                                    <p class="mb-4">My first project was a nametag where I downloaded from the project outline which did not include any documentation. My workflow steps started with importing the nametag stl file into PrusaSlicer and then editing the texts to print my name and aligning it to make it look better. Then I exported it onto a USB drive and filled out the job number request form and put down my information on a sticky note. I inserted the USB into the Prusa Mini printer and let it print. It turned out well however I realized only after I was done printing that the color change did not work. I relearned how to do a color print and I will attempt it on a future project. Something I learned is how to load filament into the printer for color switches to just start a print. I also learned the difference between a stl and 3mf file. A stl file only stores surface geometry and meshes of triangles. So if you have multiple pieces, a stl will turn it all into one piece. While for 3mf, it is more advanced and can store more information like color and textures. If you have multiple pieces, 3mf will keep them separate as individual parts.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">I downloaded a spider torture test from printables that tests overhangs, cooling, bed adhesion, and retraction based on the documentation. The creator recommended if we want to test anything to not try to do multiple chances all at once. They also recommended maximum cooling and a brim if you don’t have great bed adhesion but since we are testing the limits of the printer, I didn’t add or change anything. After printing it, the results turned out really well despite not having any supports and rafts. The only thing that I didn't expect was that the PLA was very stringy because of the printer settings not sucking the filament back in when it switches locations. The spider also did not print the x symbol on its head most likely because I printed it on its head and the bed of the printer melted it smooth. It is around 1.7x2.1 inches which is accurate. Something I learned from this project is how versatile 3D printing is. There is so much you can print and you never know if you don't try printing it. You can really push the limits a lot but some limits include extreme overhangs (if you don’t include supports), accuracy (if the size is too small), etc.</p>

It is made for anyone who likes playing Nintendo. Sometimes when you are playing multiplayer, you only get one side of the controller and this will make it easier to hold without getting cramps in your hand from how small the controller is. It was made by Semmel on Printables. There was little to no documentation mostly because the print is very straightforward so it didn’t need much documentation the documentation is pretty efficient. The documentation told me I didn’t need support, however I still added support just in case because the controller does not print flat on the ground. Some changes I would suggest would be that we would probably simplify the design because this print is very bulky and uses up a lot of filament. My process involved downloading and importing it into Prusa and printing it with organic support. After it was done printing, I removed the supports with pliers. It turned out well, I just kept removing pieces that were necessary. There are parts that are very delicate that I almost broke. Sometimes I learned that I have to be very careful when using pliers or I could potentially ruin the print.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">My idea for this project was to make an item that could hold something so I started on I wanted to make a hairband holder with hooks on the side for extra hairhand storage. I will also print my name on it to personalize it. I started the project on TinkerCAD. I learned that TinkerCAD is very easy for beginners to use since it has lots of pre-made items like diamonds, stars, hearts, etc. The difficult part is rounding out the sides because it is not a feature on TinkerCAD so I have to do it myself. It is also difficult to adjust blocks because it autolocks in place and so I have to put in coordinates when I want to place it somewhere specific or else it will be out of place. Then, I moved on and remade it on Fusion which was much easier because I could be more exact with my measurements and it has a Fillet tool to round out the edges. Fusion is more advanced than TinkerCAD and I was able to make it much faster. Since I have some experience with SolidWorks and Onshape, Fusion was more comfortable to use. I have to relearn some of the controls because they were different from what I was used to on OnShape. Something I could have done better and worked on more is the sizing because the sizes of the two holders do not match up. Both physical phototypes look good but the “Sophia” text on TinkerCAD looks better because I couldn’t get how to adjust the text on Fusion. But overall, I prefer Fusion over TinkerCAD. I did not print this project so there was no CAM involved and no influences resulting in my print. I achieved my goal of understanding TinkerCAD and Fusion better and what my preferences are in a CAD application. I could optimize my design further by making it wider because it may not be easy for people with larger hands to reach into since it is a pretty small model. Something in the design that I would like to change would be its visual design because it's not the most pleasant to look at, it is very basic. I could make it more stylistic with curves and designs. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">My idea for this project was a cute duckie keycap with accessories. I planned it on paper of accessories I could give the duckie. After I had it all planned out, I downloaded a duckie keycap off printables as a stl file and I imported it into TinkerCAD. The duck file provided no documentation for me to go off during CAM. I decided on a top hat and a tie. Making the hat was easy since it was just two cylinders that I resized. However, for the tie, TinkerCAD did not have the correct shapes so I had to merge and group shapes like triangles and rectangles to make the shake. It was also hard to position it right without the tie going straight into the duck. Some tips I have for using TinkerCAD would be utilizing the little measurement popup, you can click it and edit the number on how far you want to move the object. It is way more precise than using the arrow and dragging the object. A question I have about TinkerCAD is if there is an easier way to make new shapes that aren’t already provided by TinkerCAD. After finishing my remixing on TinkerCAD, I saved it and imported it into Prusa Slicer. It recommended a raft and supports so I made organic supports and a size 2 raft. Then I exported it onto a usb and printed it in a gold color. After printing, I removed the raft and supports and it turned out really well. I achieved my goal because I was able to successfully print duckie keycaps. A design element I would change to improve it would be the sizing. I may have printed a bit too small to put on my keyboard but other than that, it turned out really well. I learned that I should print them a little bigger to give it some wiggle room since the printer isn’t the most accurate.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">For my Fusion remix, I didn’t want to do the duckie keycap again and I wanted to try remixing with multiple stl files instead. I started sketching and I decided on a cup with flowers. Something I had a lot of difficulty with on this project was finding something to remix because every design I came across looked so complex that if I remixed it, it would look even worse. Originally, I wanted to do an animal cup but I decided on an cup and then I found a flower that I liked. I searched on printables for a good design and found an abstract cup and small flowers that I liked. I put the cup into Fusion and then I added the flower and repositioned and scaled it. It looked like a long time because I needed to make sure the flowers were attached and not floating in air but also that they weren't stuck in the cup. I kept copy and pasting the flowers around my cup. After I finished, I realized the holder wasn’t hollow so I had to convert the mesh into a solid but by doing that, since the holder was so complex and contained over 10,000 thousand triangles, my Fusion crashed and I had to restart. I had to decimate the dense mesh so my computer could handle it. Then I extruded inwards to make a hole. It was extremely frustrating because I was scared that it wouldn’t work and I would have to restart and choose a new design. However, Professor Krones assisted me and helped me instruct me on what to do. Eventually, I successfully changed it into a solid and hollowed it out but by then, I wanted to change my design. I changed my design by adding a scary face and t-rex arms onto it. I also added a torus at the top just for experimentation. This whole process was very hard and I had to watch lots of tutorials and I managed to complete it in the end. After the CAD was done, I moved onto CAM. I exported it onto Prusa Slicer and scaled it down and added organic supports. While the abstract holder stl I downloaded recommended no supports, I still added supports since I added more to the cup and it has some lots of overhang. After printing, I removed all of the supports and it turned out super nice. It turned out way better than I expected it to look. I achieved my goal of creating a pencil holder but it just has a different design on it than I imagined. To optimize my design, I can learn to hollow out more sides. I would need to learn different methods because I am working with a complex shape. By hollowing it out more, I can allow the holder to hold more items. I would change the design to look less scary because while I think it is very creative and funny, some people may be scared of it. But overall, it turned out super well. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">Pre-assembling reflection: <br>Some challenges I expect to face are being precise in the placement of solder because the board is so small and I could accidentally overfill or underfill the holes and need to be careful about not burning any of the pieces or losing them. The paper instruction manual is very bad and it would be very difficult to build off of because of the lack of pictures and instructions. Something good about the paper manual is that it tells you how many pieces there are of each and what they are called for us to find when reading the online instruction manual. However, the online instruction manual is very helpful and provides detailed instructions and good visuals to go off of. Something I would change about the paper instruction manual is including pictures and more detailed instructions. 

<br><br>Post-assembling reflection: <br>This project is about assembling a radio from a kit. My partner and I worked on one radio together which we shared. We started by watching soldering tutorials and practiced our soldering before starting on the actual radio. The radio we chose had bad paper documentation so we found the documentation online which was much more helpful because it included visual representations and actual instructions. We followed the instructions all the way through. All the soldering went relatively smoothly but I made a few mistakes here and there that were luckily fixable. I accidentally put solder in a hole that I wasn’t supposed to fill yet and so we had to suck the solder back out which was very difficult because it was stuck in there. Luckily we were able to get it out with the solder suckers. When we got to the base plate soldering, we got help from Ian. Ian showed us a new technique using flux on the board and pre-applying the solder and melting the usb on. It was very difficult because we had to use magnifying glasses to see the soldering clearly because it was so small. It was scary because I had to be extremely close to the soldier to see it with the magnifying glasses on. We used the camera app on our phone a lot to help see the soldier. We also had to be careful not to melt nearby pieces and the board because it is very delicate. After we finished, we put in the battery to test if it worked and it worked!! Everything was working properly, we were able to change the program, change the volume, turn it on and off, and see the screen light up. Overall, I think we were very successful. We decided against building another one to save time and have one to share between us while we make our own enclosure. Our strategy to divide up the work was by rotating. For example, I would do two solders and then they would do the next two and we would keep rotating so we each got a chance to solder everything. I learned how careful I had to be because not only is there a risk of burning the board and pieces, it is also very easy to burn yourself and accidentally hurt yourself with the smoke and the hot tip.

                                    <p class="mb-4">This project is part two of the previous project on assembling a radio. We have to design an enclosure for the radio that can control the tuner, hear the speaker, move the antenna, and access the power. First, I measured all the dimensions using the digital calipers and wrote it down on paper. Then I sketched a design plan for an enclosure to be produced on the 3D printers. My idea was to make a sliding door so I can put everything inside and change the battery and then open rectangles to see the screen and access the buttons. I also made a hole on top for the antenna to stick out of. Then I modeled my design in Fusion. Since this is my own design, there was no documentation. The colors did not matter to me for the first print because it was my test print to see if the dimensions and the holes are where they are meant to be. I did not adjust any of the print settings but in the slicer settings, I placed it on the top of the enclosure so it would save filament and not need as many supports. After the print was finished, I realized that the antenna hole was placed on the wrong side and the walls of my enclosure were too thin so my sliding door would fall off very easily. Since I did not use parameters for my design, I had to remake the whole thing which was very tedious. I fixed all my mistakes and reprinted it. I printed it in a reflective gray color to make it similar to the color of real old radios that I have seen before. I thought this print would be my last one however it wasn’t because I printed it, it was too thin and I couldn’t fit my pieces into it. I also slid the door in and out so much that the sliding door broke. I accidentally made the width the exact same as the battery so there was no tolerance to slide the pieces in. I fixed it again and added legs this time so the sliding door wouldn’t be sitting on the table. I also readjusted the width. This time, it printed correctly and it works. It is definitely not perfect, however it does its job of containing the pieces. When I have time, I will print decorations to glue on to it to make it more visually appealing. I want to print cute pigs and stick them on, Something I learned from this is how useful and essential it is to use parameters. </p>

                                    <p class="mb-4">This project is part three the the previous two projects where I will design another enclosure but with laser printing and with the same affordances. I got laser printing training from Professor Krones and I printed a name tag. My name tag was too big which taught me that it is better to design in fusion first because it gives exact measurements and then we transfer it to LightBurn. Then, I followed along with the finger joint box tutorial and learned how to use parameters as well. I printed out the box I made from the tutorial to practice assembling it and it worked perfectly. I went back into fusion and revised the parameters to the dimensions I had on the 3D printed enclosure and added holes for the screens, buttons, and antenna. I exported them as dxf files and put them on a usb to print. I reprinted it and the radio fit inside well and everything was accessible but it was slightly too big. In general, it was a really good print and if I left it as it is, it would have worked perfectly fine. However, I wanted to make it a little smaller so the buttons could stick out. I readjusted the parameters which was very difficult because by making the side lengths smaller, I also had to make the little connectors smaller and it would change for every side which I didn’t want. I printed it and it was unsuccessful. The enclosure was way too small because I forgot to account for the battery container which was taller than the rest of the other pieces. So for now, I am going to stick with my second print until I get more time to go back and reprint another enclosure. In general, the tutorial gives very good instructions and documentation. Something I had difficulty with was the tools in Fusion that make all the lines the same length, I had to use a different strategy because my Fusion did not work like theirs. Other than that, I felt like this enclosure went pretty well. I learned how to design something to print on a laser printer and how to use parameters. </p>
